## ðŸš€ How to Run as a PWA

### 1. Serve the App from a Local or Public Server
- **Important**: You must serve the app over HTTP/HTTPS (not open `index.html` directly) for PWA features to work.
- Use any local server (Python, Node.js, etc.) or deploy to a public host (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages).

#### Local Server Options

**Python 3:**
```sh
python -m http.server 8000
```
Then access at `http://localhost:8000`

**Node.js:**
```sh
npx serve .
```

### 2. Access from Your Phone (Optional)
- Ensure your phone is on the same Wi-Fi as your PC
- Find your PC's local IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.5`)
- On your phone, open Chrome and navigate to `http://<your-pc-ip>:8000`

### 3. Install as a Home Screen App (PWA)
- In Chrome (or Edge) on your phone, open the app URL
- Tap the three-dot menu and select **"Add to Home screen"** or **"Install app"**
- The app will appear on your home screen and function like a native app

### 4. Use the App Offline
- After installation, launch the app from your home screen icon
- All features work offline thanks to service worker caching

## ðŸ›  Technical Details

### Service Worker & Manifest
- **Service Worker**: Caches all core files for offline functionality
- **Web App Manifest**: Provides app name, icon, and installability features
- **Cache Management**: Update cache name in `service-worker.js` to force new file downloads
